# Raycasting
Implementing a basic Raycasting renderer in C similiar to [Wolfenstein 3D](https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d):

* Walls are perpendicular with the floor
* Floor is flat
* Walls are made of cubes with the same size

I'm adding a Javascript prototype to test the maths and a implementation in C with [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
